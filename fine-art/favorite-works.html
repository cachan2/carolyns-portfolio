                        Some of my favorite works that I made were the singular rose, the succulents, and the two suspended 
                        gymnasts. The rose is covered in frost, and I wanted to recreate it with my skills and abilities that 
                        I had back in high school. I first drew the basic shapes of the petals and the background, and started 
                        to detail the look of the snow and frost. From what I remember, it took nearly six to eight hours creating 
                        it, and I felt so happy with how it turned out. To make it more dimensional, I also added blue accents 
                        to accentuate the white and red of the picture.

                    The succulents were from my grandmaâ€™s garden, and the day before it had just rained. The succulents had 
                    tiny dewdrops on it, and I took a picture of it to recreate it. I wanted to practice using light colors and 
                    seeing how it would work when making dewdrops that were just as bright.

                    Lastly, the gymnasts one was so that I could practice my human anatomy drawing. Drawing the human body 
                    is some of the toughest parts of art, making sure that everything is proportionate as well as anatomically 
                    correct. This drawing let me practice drawing the female and male anatomy, and my favorite figure drawings 
                    are gymnasts or contortionists. The human body will accentuate certain muscles and give interesting poses, 
                    which is why drawing human figures is one of my favorite pass times.
